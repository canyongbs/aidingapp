# Glossary

The purpose of this document is to keep reference of terms used by Product or Development that differ in their meaning to the other party, are not directly used by the other party, or otherwise benefit from additional context.

A term should be cataloged here if:

- It is wholly not used in the same way by both parties
- It is a term used by development that should NEVER appear in User facing UI
- We have changed the name of something in the Product UI for any reason and will not or have not yet updated code and/or database schema
- The team would otherwise benefit from having a record of it providing context

## Product Terms

## Development Terms
